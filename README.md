The Real-time microkernel (RTMK) project involved the development of a microkernel using an Arduino Due, a J-Link debugger, and IAR software. The project was a culmination of three separate labs, with the report discussing the operation of the RTMK, the use of assisting libraries such as doubly linked lists and queues, testing procedures. The RTMK's importance as a mediator between hardware and the operating system was emphasized, and its ability to create, manage, and remove tasks was explored. The report also highlighted the crucial role of testing in validating the RTMK's functionality. The project provided valuable experience in microkernel development and offered insights into the challenges and opportunities in this field. # Real-time-Microkernel
